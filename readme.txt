For my game I decided to do Pacman. Everything about it is basically the same as the original game. Use up, down, left, and right keys to control pacman, avoid the ghosts, eat all the dots, etc. You get an extra life every 3 levels, and the ghosts will get harder each level up to a certain point where they are basically at max difficulty. Press start during the game to pause, press select at any time to quit.
